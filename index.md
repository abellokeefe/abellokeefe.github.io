### Bio:

Currently, my interests are in applying machine learning methods to analyze fetal heart rates in real time during and before labor. I am collaborating with nurses in my local area and computer scientists with expereince in machine learning to develop new ways to identify patterns in fetal ECG readings that may indicate potential life-threatening diseases like bradycardia. 

My dream is to see this research become impact women at home, enabeling their infant's health to be monitored from home. I believe an ability to monitor fetal heart rates remotely and affordably would transform prenatal health care, increasing the survival rate of preterm infants globally and especially in remote areas. 

I am a student of Computer Science at Colorado State University's online campus, a student of Mathematics at Southern New Hampshire University and a student of Data Science at Lambda School. 

I'm a math and data science student who lives in Salt Lake City, UT.
