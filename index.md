### Bio:

Currently, my interests are in applying machine learning methods to analyze fetal heart rates in real time, during and before labor. I am collaborating with nurses in my local area and computer scientists with expereince in machine learning to develop new ways to identify patterns in fetal ECG readings that may indicate potential life-threatening diseases like bradycardia. 

My dream is to see this research impact women's health, enabeling their pregnancy to be monitored from home. I believe an ability to monitor fetal heart rates remotely and affordably would transform prenatal health care. This will help lower the mortality rate due to [Birth Asphyxia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430782/), providing healthcare providers and mothers with continuous, real-time information on the infant's heartrate - our best indicator life-threatening conditions related to birth asphyxia and birth trauma.

I am a student of Computer Science at Colorado State University's online campus, a student of Mathematics at Southern New Hampshire University and a student of Data Science at Lambda School. 

I'm a student, mathematician and computer scientist living in Salt Lake City, UT.
